For the purpose of the tutorial activity, you will be working as a group on a single project to create a command line version of Jeopardy with support for up to four players, use the source files provided and the following project requirements and guidelines to complete the project.
In addition, it is also advised that when working on the code you frequently push your code to GitHub so that other group members can stay in sync. Also, it is recommended that each group member work on separate source files. This avoids merge conflicts, which can happen when two or more people are working on the same section of code.
